## Logo
Place your logo image file here as `logo.png`.

The logo should be:
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- Recommended size: At least 200x200 pixels for best quality
- The logo will be displayed in circular/square containers, so ensure it has appropriate padding

The logo file should be named exactly: `logo.png`

## Hero Background Image
Place your hero background image here as `hero-bg.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`).

The image should be:
- High resolution (recommended: 1920x1080 or larger)
- Optimized for web (compressed but good quality)
- Shows the rural/farm scene with animals and veterinary products

Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`

If the image is not found, the hero section will fall back to a gradient background.
